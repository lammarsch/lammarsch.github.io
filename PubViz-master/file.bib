	abstract = {Temporal Data Mining is a core concept of Knowledge Discovery in Databases handling time-oriented data. State-of-the-art methods are capable of preserving the temporal order of events as well as the temporal intervals in between. The temporal characteristics of the events themselves, however, can likely lead to numerous uninteresting patterns found by current approaches. We present a new definition of the temporal characteristics of events and enhance related work for pattern finding by utilizing temporal relations, like meets, starts, or during, instead of just intervals between events. These prerequisites result in a new procedure for Temporal Data Mining that preserves and mines additional time-oriented information. Our procedure is supported by an interactive visual interface for exploring the patterns. Furthermore, we illustrate the effciency of our procedure presenting an benchmark of the procedure\&rsquo;s run-time behavior. A usage scenario shows how the procedure can provide new insights.},

This activity cannot be automated for previously unknown malware families and thus malware analysts would benefit greatly from integrating visual analytics methods in their process. However existing approaches are limited to fairly static representations of data and there is no systematic characterization and abstraction of this problem domain. Therefore we performed a systematic literature study, conducted a focus group as well as semi-structured interviews with 10 malware analysts to elicit a problem abstraction along the lines of data, users, and tasks. The requirements emerging from this work can serve as basis for future design proposals to visual analytics-supported malware pattern analysis.},

At the same time, the need to analyse large multivariate time-oriented datasets often calls for keeping visualizations as compact as possible. In this paper, we introduce Qualizon Graphs, a compact visualization that combines quantitative data and qualitative abstractions. It is based on the well known Horizon Graphs, but instead of a predefined number of equally sized bands, it uses as many bands as qualitative categories with corresponding different sizes. In this way, Qualizon Graphs increase the data density of visualized quantitative values and inherently integrate qualitative abstractions. A user study shows that Qualizon Graphs are as fast and accurate as Horizon Graphs for quantitative data, and are an alternative to state-of-the-art visualizations for both quantitative and qualitative data, enabling a trade-off between speed and accuracy.},

	abstract = {Recent research in Visualization has focused mostly on data analysis systems for domain experts, but also considered presentation to external people in the form of storytelling. The established directions assume that the target audience has in inherent interest in the facts to be discovered, sometimes even to the point of them being willing to learn how to operate a complex visualization system and spend considerable time and effort. In reality, sometimes the opposite is true: people unwilling to face an inconvenient truth actively avert their eyes. As a solution, we propose the presentation of facts by experts who manage to gain a limited amount of attention by means of rapid and expressive visualization. Using conventional desktop systems, this method is hard to implement, but new visual channels will open up new possibilities.},

Although there are tools to help users with the task of data cleansing, support for dealing with the specifics of time-oriented data is rather poor. However, the time dimension has very specific characteristics which introduce quality problems, that are different from other kinds of data. We present TimeCleanser, an interactive Visual Analytics system to support the task of data cleansing of ime-oriented data. In order to help the user to deal with these special characteristics and quality problems, TimeCleanser combines semi-automatic quality checks, visualizations, and directly editable data tables. The evaluation of the TimeCleanser system within a focus group (two target users, one developer, and two Human Computer Interaction experts) shows that (a) our proposed method is suited to detect hidden quality problems of time-oriented data and (b) that it facilitates the complex task of data cleansing.</p>},

Evaluation showed the benefits of this approach. However, experts also expressed the demand for prediction capabilities as being already important during the model selection process. Furthermore, good model candidates might show only small variations in the information criteria and structures which are not easily recognizable in the residual plots. To achieve this, we propose TiMoVA-Predict to close the gap and to support different types of predictions with a Visual Analytics approach. Providing prediction capabilities in addition to the information criteria and the residual plots, allows for interactively assessing the predictions during the model selection process via an visual exploration environment.},

Asymmetrically large two-way contingency tables pose a problem for common visualization methods. The Contingency Wheel has been recently proposed as an interactive visual method to explore and analyze such tables. However, the scalability and readability of this method are limited when dealing with large and dense tables. In this paper we present Contingency Wheel++, new visual analytics methods that overcome these major shortcomings: (1) regarding automated methods, a measure of association based on Pearson\&rsquo;s residuals alleviates the bias of the raw residuals originally used, (2) regarding visualization methods, a frequency-based abstraction of the visual elements eliminates overlapping and makes analyzing both positive and negative associations possible, and (3) regarding the interactive exploration environment, a multi-level overview+detail interface enables exploring individual data items that are aggregated in the visualization or in the table using coordinated views. We illustrate the applicability of these new methods with a use case and show how they enable discovering and analyzing nontrivial patterns and associations in large categorical data.

Explorative analysis of this kind of data is often difficult and overwhelming at the level of raw data. Temporal data abstraction reduces data complexity by deriving qualitative statements that reflect domain-specific key characteristics. Visual representations of abstractions and raw data together with appropriate interaction methods can support analysts in making their data easier to understand. Such a visualization technique that applies smooth semantic zooming has been developed in the context of patient data analysis. However, no empirical evidence on its effectiveness and efficiency is available. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by reporting on a controlled experiment that compares this technique with another visualization method used in the well-known KNAVE-II framework. Both methods integrate quantitative data with qualitative abstractions whereas the first one uses a composite representation with color-coding to display the qualitative data and spatial position coding for the quantitative data. The second technique uses juxtaposed representations for quantitative and qualitative data with spatial position coding for both. Results show that the test persons using the composite representation were generally faster, particularly for more complex tasks that involve quantitative values as well as qualitative abstractions.

Albeit systematic approaches to categorize, detect, and avoid data quality problems exist, the special characteristics of time-oriented data are hardly considered. However, time is an important data dimension with distinct characteristics which affords special consideration in the context of dirty data. Building upon existing taxonomies of general data quality problems, we address dirty time-oriented data, i.e., time-oriented data with potential quality problems. In particular, we investigated empirically derived problems that emerge with different types of time-oriented data (e.g., time points, time intervals) and provide various examples of quality problems of time-oriented data. By providing categorized information related to existing taxonomies, we establish a basis for further research in the field of dirty time-oriented data, and for the formulation of essential quality checks when preprocessing time-oriented data.},

	abstract = {A well-designed visualization of dynamic networks has to support the analysis of both temporal and relational features at once. In particular to solve complex synoptic tasks, the users need to understand the topological structure of the network, its evolution over time, and possible interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the application of the vertigo zoom interaction technique, derived from filmmaking, to information visualizations. When applied to a two-and-a-half-dimensional view, this interaction technique enables smooth transitions between the relational perspective (node-link diagrams and scatter plots) and the time perspective (trajectories and line charts), supporting a seamless visual analysis and preserving the user's mental map.

How and why interactivity is beneficial to gain insight and make decisions is mostly left in the dark. Due to this lack of initial direction, it seems important to make further attempts in facilitating a deeper understanding of the concept of interactivity. Therefore, different perspectives towards interactivity are discussed and cognitive theories and models are investigated. The main aim of this paper is to broaden the view on interaction and spark further discussion towards a sound theoretical grounding for the field.

The dynamic and multi-relational nature of this data poses the challenge of understanding both its topological structure and how it changes over time. In this paper we propose a visual analytics approach for analyzing dynamic networks that integrates: a dynamic layout with user-controlled trade-off between stability and consistency; three temporal views based on different combinations of node-link diagrams (layer superimposition, layer juxtaposition, and two-and-a-half dimensional view); the visualization of social network analysis metrics; and specific interaction techniques for tracking node trajectories and node connectivity over time. This integration of visual, interactive, and automatic methods supports the multifaceted analysis of dynamically changing networks.

<div class="springerHTML">
	This book starts with an introduction to visualization and a number of historical examples of visual representations. At its core, the book presents and discusses a systematic view of the visualization of time-oriented data. This view is structured along three key questions. While the aspects of time and associated data describe <i>what</i> is being visualized, user tasks are related to the question <i>why</i> something is visualized. These characteristics and tasks determine <i>how </i>the visualization is to be designed. To support visual exploration, interaction techniques and analytical methods are required as well, which are discussed in separate chapters. The concepts explained in this book are illustrated with numerous examples.
	A large part of this book is devoted to a structured survey of existing techniques for visualizing time and time-oriented data. Overall, 101 different visualization techniques are presented on a per-page basis; each of these self-contained descriptions is accompanied by an illustration and corresponding references.\&nbsp; This survey serves as a reference for scientists conducting related research as well as for practitioners seeking information on how their time-oriented data can best be visualized in order to gain valuable insights.

State-of-theart visualizations hardly take advantage of the structures of time to aid users in understanding and exploring the data. To bring more flexibility to the analysis process, we have developed interactive visual methods incorporating the structures of time within a pixel-based visualization called GROOVE (granular overview overlay). GROOVE uses different techniques to visualize time-oriented data by overlaying several time granularities in one visualization and provides interactive operators, which utilize the structures of time in different ways to capture and explore time-oriented data.

	abstract = {The development and success of many organizations to a large extent depend on how well and how timely they manage to gain insight into collected data. Business Intelligence (BI) provides methods for analyzing business-critical information and suppor ts decision-making processes. But the ever growing amounts of data and information clearly overwhelm traditional manual methods of data analysis such as spreadsheets, standard repor ting or simple diagrams. One possibility to face this problem is Information Visualization (InfoVis). By utilizing the powerful human perceptual system that is extremely efficient in processing visual input, visualization, for example, can help to make sense of data, explore complex information spaces or spot patterns and relationships within the data. Interactivity or the possibility to engage in an active discourse with the representation lies at the core of Information Visualization. However, empirical evidence and detailed approaches to model the concept of interactivity are largely missing in research today. This thesis is a first step towards bridging this gap and approaching the concept of interactivity more in depth. In order to do so, a twofold approach was chosen. First, the concept of interactivity was investigated from a theoretical point of view. In par ticular, cognitive theories and models were analyzed in order to determine their ability to explain and predict the value and role of interactivity in visual methods. Second, a qualitative empirical study was conducted among six IT-managers working in the field of Business Intelligence to assess the current practice at work concerning visual methods and interactivity. The main results are that cognitive theories and models do not explicitly account for the role of interactivity but rather concentrate on modeling the elements of a cognitive system and explaining how these entities interact with each other to achieve a cer tain goal. How different types of interactivity influence these processes is usually not par t of the theories, and the effect of interactivity on cognitive processes was hardly ever mentioned. Apart from that, the empirical study showed that interactive visual methods in the area of Business Intelligence aren{\textquoteright}t used ver y often. One of the main reasons repor ted is the fact that visualization is still two steps ahead and at the moment mostly more basic problems concerning data gathering, data modeling and data quality prevail. Moreover, most users are used to work with numbers and tables and are not aware of the possibilities in terms of visualization. However, the inter viewed IT-managers acknowledged that using more interactive visual methods in Business Intelligence would be beneficial for users.},

	Recently, web browser based applications have become very popular in many domains. However, the specific requirements of interactive Information Visualization (InfoVis) applications in terms of graphics performance and interactivity have not yet been investigated systematically in this context. In order to assess browser-based application platforms, we provide a systematic comparison of server-based rendering, Java applets, Flash, and Silverlight from several points of view. We aim to aid InfoVis developers in choosing the appropriate technology for their needs.

In this paper, we focus on the unique role of the parameter time in the context of visually driven data analysis. We will discuss three major concerns \&ETH; visualization, analysis, and the user. It will be illustrated that it is necessary to consider the characteristics of time when generating visual representations. For that purpose we take a look at different types of time and present visual examples. Integrating visual and analytical methods has become an increasingly important issue. Therefore, we present our experiences in temporal data abstraction, principal component analysis, and clustering of larger volumes of time-oriented data. The third main aspect we discuss is supporting user-centered visual analysis. We describe event-based visualization as a promising means to adapt the visualization pipeline to needs and tasks of users.

	abstract = {Objective: Currently, visualization support for patient data analysis is mostly limited to the representation of directly measured data. Contextual information on performed treatment steps is an important source to find reasons and explanations for certain phenomena in the measured patient data, but is mostly spared out in the analysis process. This work aims to fill this gap via integrating classical data visualization and visualization of treatment information. Methods and Material: We considered temporal as well as logical data as- pects and applied a user-centered development approach that was guided by user input gathered via a user study, design reviews, and prototype evaluations. Further- more, we investigated the novel PlanningLine glyph, that is used to represent plans in the temporal domain, via a comparative empirical user study. Results: Our interactive visualization approach CareVis provides multiple simul- taneous views to cover different aspects of the complex underlying data structure of treatment plans and patient data. The tightly coupled views use visualization methods well-known to domain experts and are designed to facilitate users\&$\#$39; tasks. The views are based on the concepts of clinical algorithm maps and LifeLines which have been extended in order to cope with the powerful and expressive plan rep- resentation language Asbru. Initial feedback of physicians was encouraging and is accompanied by empirical evidence which verifies that PlanningLines are well suited to manage temporal uncertainty. Conclusion: The interactive integration of different visualization methods forms a novel way of combining, relating, and analyzing different kinds of medical data and information that otherwise would be separated.

Einer Studie der UC Berkeley zufolge wurden im Jahr 2002 weltweit sch{\"a}tzungsweise vier Exabyte an einzigartigen Informationen digital gespeichert, wobei angenommen wird, dass sich dieser Wert j{\"a}hrlich um 30\% erh{\"o}ht. Das sind vier Milliarden Gigabyte (1018 Bytes) an Text, Zahlen, Bildern und anderen Formen digitaler Informationen. Erschwerend ist, dass sich die M{\"o}glichkeit immer mehr Daten zu speichern wesentlich schneller entwickelt, als die F{\"a}higkeit diese Daten auch zu analysieren.

	GIS Funktionalit\&auml;t ist mehr gefragt denn je. So verzeichnete die Suchmaschine Google f\&uuml;r das Jahr 2004 das Schlagwort \&$\#$39;Routenplaner\&acute; als den meistgesuchten Begriff. Die Modellierung, Entwicklung und Nutzung geographischer Informationssysteme ist l\&auml;ngst nicht mehr eine Dom\&auml;ne der Geowissenschaften. Visualisierungs- und Analysem\&ouml;glichkeiten raumbezogener Daten stehen im Interesse vieler unterschiedlicher Anwender. Dazu ist nicht immer teure, kommerzielle Software notwendig. Eine Vielzahl freier und quelloffener GIS Projekte sind im Internet verf\&uuml;gbar. Die breite Nutzung dieser Software wird allerdings durch die Notwendigkeit speziell geographischen Vorwissens behindert. Wir untersuchen im vorliegenden Beitrag Elemente, die die Benutzerfreundlichkeit von GIS Software bestimmen und analysieren deren Umsetzung in freier und quelloffener GIS Software. Als konkretes Beispiel wird der GIS Einsatz f\&uuml;r freiwillige Feuerwehren untersucht. Administrative Daten sollen f\&uuml;r Pr\&auml;sentationszwecke mit einer Visualisierungssoftware aufbereitet werden. Ziel ist es, die Nutzerfreudlichkeit eines freien und quelloffenen GIS, anhand der Elemente der naiven Geographie zu untersuchen (EGENHOFER \&amp; MARK 1995).

	In recent years the Olympic Games have undergone vast criticism due to perceived subjective scoring in judgedevents, as for example figure skating and gymnastics. Judges\&acute; scores may be influenced by favoritism, humanerror, or possibly corruption. Audience participation in scoring represents a promising approach to meet theseproblems. In this paper we present an audience voting system that utilizes the natural behavior of sportsspectators: clapping and cheering. The system consists of wireless motion sensors and microphones that enablespectators to cast their vote in real time. The sensors are worn by audience members and determine the clappingfrequency of each participant. This facilitates continuous influence on the score throughout an athlete\&acute;s performance.The audience score is presented on wall-sized stadium displays and might be contrasted with the judges\&acute; scores toencourage audience engagement.

	Abstract Computer supported protocol-based care aims to aid physicians in the treatment process. The main focus of current research is directed towards the formal methods and representations used \&ldquo;behind the scenes\&rdquo; of such systems. This work on the contrary, is situated at the human end of the human-machine chain. We describe the development of interactive visualization methods to support protocol-based care. We provide multiple simultaneous views to cover different aspects of a complex underlying data structure of treatment plans and patient data. The tightly coupled views use visualization methods well-known to domain experts and are designed to facilitate users\&rsquo; tasks. The views are based on the concepts of clinical algorithm maps and LifeLines which have been extended in order to cope with the powerful and expressive plan representation language Asbru. The user-centered development approach applied for these interactive visualization methods has been guided by user input gathered via a user study, design reviews, and prototype evaluations.

	Abstract English: This thesis presents methods to support protocol-based care in medicine. Timeoriented treatment plans and patient data are represented visually providing various interaction possibilities to aid execution and analysis of medical therapy plans formulated in the representation language Asbru. We introduce a two-view approach consisting of a Logical View and a Temporal View. The Logical View depicts therapy plans using a flow-chart like representation based on {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}clinical algorithms\&$\#$39;\&$\#$39;. The Temporal View on the other hand depicts plans as well as patient data in form of parameters and variables over time. The plan visualization method within the Temporal View is based on the idea of LifeLines. For being able to depict hierarchical structures and temporal uncertainties, we extended this concept and a novel glyph called PlanningLine has been developed. We present a number of existing visualization approaches addressing concepts that can be found in Asbru and discuss their usefulness for our purpose. A user study with eight domain experts (physicians) was conducted at the beginning of this work to acquire requirements and goals for the development. Furthermore, a software prototype has been implemented and evaluated with five domain experts who judged it as usable and easy to understand. The findings of the user study and the evaluation are presented and discussed. Kurzfassung Deutsch: Diese Diplomarbeit beschreibt Methoden zur Unterst\&uuml;tzung von protokoll-basierter Behandlung in der Medizin. Zeitbezogene Behandlungspl\&auml;ne und Patientendaten werden visuell dargestellt und besitzen eine Reihe von Interaktionsm\&ouml;glichkeiten f\&uuml;r die Ausf\&uuml;hrung und Analyse von medizinischen Therapiepl\&auml;nen, die in der Planrepr\&auml;sentationssprache Asbru verfasst sind. Wir stellen einen Ansatz bestehend aus zwei Ansichten - einer logischen und einer zeitbezogenen - vor. In der logischen Ansicht werden Therapiepl\&auml;ne mit Hilfe einer flussdiagramm\&auml;hnlichen Darstellung basierend auf \&quot;{\textquoteleft}klinischen Algorithmen\&quot;\&$\#$39; repr\&auml;sentiert. In der zeitbezogenen Ansicht werden auf der anderen Seite sowohl Pl\&auml;ne als auch Patientendaten in Form von Parametern und Variablen \&uuml;ber der Zeit dargestellt. Die innerhalb der zeitbezogenen Ansicht verwendete Visualisierungsmethode basiert auf der Idee von LifeLines. Um sowohl hierarchische Strukturen als auch zeitliche Unsicherheiten darstellen zu k\&ouml;nnen, haben wir dieses Konzept erweitert und eine neuartige Darstellungsweise, genannt PlanningLine, entwickelt. Wir pr\&auml;sentieren eine Reihe von existierenden Visualisierungsmethoden, verschiedene Asbru bezogene Aspekte betreffend, und diskutieren ihre Brauchbarkeit f\&uuml;r unsere Zwecke. Eine Benutzerstudie mit acht Dom\&auml;nenexperten (\&Auml;rzten) wurde zu Beginn der Arbeit durchgef\&uuml;hrt, um die Anforderungen und Ziele f\&uuml;r die Entwicklung zu erarbeiten. Weiters wurde ein Software Prototyp implementiert und mit f\&uuml;nf Dom\&auml;nenexperten evaluiert, die ihn hinsichtlich Brauchbarkeit und Verst\&auml;ndlichkeit sehr positiv beurteilten. Die Ergebnisse der Benutzerstudie und der Evaluation werden ebenfalls pr\&auml;sentiert und diskutiert.

This tool is designed for execution support only and not for the creation of clinicalguidelines like the already existing tool AsbruView. The main purpose of this software is to provide a compact overview that is easy to read andunderstand. This overview has two functions: At the one hand side it should allow a comparison of the actual state of a patient and the assigned clinical guideline. On the otherhand side it should be possible to compare several patients at one view. This view includes at most five patients synchronously.},
