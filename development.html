<a href="publications.html#Unity Publication">Native Cross-platform Visualization: A Proof of Concept Based on the Unity3D Game Engine</a>
</div>

<p>
Following up on the <a href="publications.html#Unity Publication">recent publication on Visualization using the Unity3D engine</a>,
I did some further testing on how <a href="https://unity3d.com">Unity3D</a> can be applied. I realized that especially for beginners,
not everything is explained a simple as needed. There are also a lot of video guides, but I belong to a group of people
who rather read up on stuff. Consequently, I solved some problems
and decided to disclose those results here. (I omitted the &quot;checked&quot; date for the links, please inform me about dead links &ndash; thank you.)

<h1>
Unity3D FAQ (from a Personal Perspective)
</h1>

<h2>[2D] How do I convert screen coordinates to world coordinates?</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">
The typical method you find for 3D coordinates
(<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera.ScreenToWorldPoint.html"><tt>Camera.ScreenToWorldPoint</tt></a>)
will not work as expected in 2D. The solution that worked for me is based on
<a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/540888/converting-mouse-position-to-world-stationary-came.html">this thread</a>:
</p>

<p class="code">
<code>Camera camera = Camera.allCameras[0]; <code class="comment">// primitve; use the way fitting for you</code>
<code class="comment">// get the plane were your objects are (assuming camera looking from z: xy-plane)</code>
Plane basePlane = new Plane(Vector3.forward, Vector3.zero);
Ray ray = camera.ScreenPointToRay(screenPosition);
float distance;
basePlane.Raycast(ray, out distance);
Vector3 worldPosition = ray.GetPoint(distance);</code>
</p>

<h2>[2D] Friction does not work &ndash; why?</h2>

<p>
Make sure that you are aware of <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PhysicsMaterial2D.html">how to use materials</a>.
If you are changing the friction a run-time, there seems to be a bug solved in <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/579995/physics-material-2d-change-during-runtime-not-taki.html">this thread</a>.
For me, however, there was another problem: I used a
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-CircleCollider2D.html">Circle Collider 2D</a>. This collider
seems to actually create a &quot;rolling&quot; object (still working on this), as expected from real world.
Thus, if you want friction slowing
down an object, use something like a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-BoxCollider2D.html">Box Collider 2D</a>.
</p>

<h2>How do a load another scene?</h2>

<p>
I found a <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/creating-a-scene-menu">video guide</a>,
yet it seems to partially use deprecated functions. You can load a scene from a script by calling
</p>
<p class="code">
<code>SceneManager.LoadScene("SceneName");</code>
</p>
<p>
The name of the scene can be set in the Unity development environment. For the scene to be loadable that way, you need to open
the build settings (Ctrl+Shift+B) and drag it into the list of scenes in the build.
